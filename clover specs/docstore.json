The Conversations Module is where, well, it\u2019s where your conversations happen!  The Conversations module is actually a multi-channel team inbox collaboration system - a rather imposing way to describe its ability to treat email, and in the future, virtually any communication channel (think Email, Twitter, SMS, Slack, Intercom, etc), as a source of messages that collectively define the interactions between trading partners in the Clover network.  That\u2019s the \u201cmulti-channel\u201d part.  The team inbox part - think of that as adding the missing features of assigning emails (like tickets) and an email being either open or closed (again, kinda like tickets), and we can turn any inbox into a collaborative, team-based workspace!\nThe Relationship Timeline\nThe relationship timeline is a conceptual timeline of all events and communications that occur within a relationship between two companies on the Clover network.  This timeline can be thought of as the continuous stream of information that is used to train Clover\u2019s AI.\nMessages and Conversations\nIf Conversations are Clover\u2019s heart then Messages are the chlorophyll running through its tiny little veins.  For most people, the idea of having a conversation by exchanging a series of messages is the most natural thing in the world.  It\u2019s relatable to everyone. And it follows that we can frame most of the activities that we engage in as either having happened within or as the result of a message in a conversation.  So, they end up being the perfect thread, along which we can weave the arc of the story of a relationship between two businesses. \n\n\nMessages\n* A message is what we call an Email on a Gmail Channel.  It\u2019s also how we will refer to a Task - as a \u201cmessage\u201d sent on the Clover Task Channel \n* A message will have 0 or more labels associated with it\n* Each message in a conversation should be addressable directly via a \u201cperma-link\u201d.  This will be used in future functionality like sharing a previous message in a conversation, with the other conversation participants.\nConversations\n* A conversation is composed of at least one message, from a given channel.  \n* A conversation may contain multiple messages, though all messages in any conversation will always come from the same channel.  \n* A conversation may contain Private Notes, Private Team Comments, as well as messages about important events in the lifecycle of the conversation.\n* A conversation (msg or task TBD[a][b][c]) can be Assigned to a User, or it can be 'Unassigned'\n* A conversation can be \"Followed\" by Users.  This causes changes made to existing conversation to \u201cbump\u201d to the top of any view it is shown in, and the conversation is marked UNREAD (and possibly 'un-ARCHIVED'*) \n* A conversation has a Status that can be set to any of the following values:[OPEN (default), CLOSED]\n* A User can create a New conversation to start a new email message and along with it, a new conversation.  \n* A User can create a New conversation to start a new Private Team Comment or a chat-only conversation with your team[d][e][f][g][h][i] on T2 and T3.  Remember that \u201cPrivate\" conversations take place among the Users at the same company\n   * User should be able to share (@mention) a conversation with anyone at their company that has a clover account.  This would have the effect of starting a conv with that person.  Take the following example:\n   * Within a team workspace, if I mention a User from my company, but not on my currently selected team workspace. As a result, that User will have the conversation shared with them,  The new conversation appears in the \u201cShared with me\u201d folder the mentioned User\u2019s private workspace\n   * Eventually we will want to be able to share outside of clover, so that this becomes a path to invite new users\n*", "doc_id": "b91763a8-2e02-4a30-a84a-8c61030986b6", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2d9e72a203891c5eb0cb52e6c014b3bc19a37f4ce7493643b87861e242c5ce47", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3867}, "relationships": {"1": "17fb4c64-4f18-404e-8d5c-3c9bb2cfe20f", "3": "895f51f9-3326-4171-b12a-d315b30849f4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "895f51f9-3326-4171-b12a-d315b30849f4": {"__data__": {"text": "your team[d][e][f][g][h][i] on T2 and T3.

Think of channels like incoming lines of communications - Email, Texting, Slack, these are all examples of channels. In the first release of Conversations v2, we will support one channel - Gmail.  We will eventually build additional Channels to support multiple communication types like Outlook365, Intercom, SMS, Twitter, Slack, etc. \nGmail Channel\nThe Gmail channel is the first of several planned to be supported.  Future channels may include Twitter, SMS/MMS, FaceBook Messenger, Intercom and others.  A Gmail channel is intended to be connected (we\u2019ll call these \u201cchannel connections\u201d) to a single gmail account.  When this connection is established, the emails, labels and contacts in that account will begin synchronizing with Clover.  Access to Gmail channel connections is planned to be a feature available to T2 and T3.\nTask Channel\nClover\u2019s Task management features use email messages to communicate task assignments.  In this way, Users are able to:\n* Assign and reassign tasks\n* Communicate with other users in their team or company about a task\n* View the status of a task\n* Link to the task itself\n* See the task history information\nThe Clover Task Channel is available at all pricing tiers.\nTasks \nTasks allow companies to request, manage and respond to requests for information for their trading partners.  Tasks can move information in both free and structured formats, between companies in either direction (providing or requesting it), in an easily auditable manner.\nIn the version of Clover that is deployed at the time of this document, tasks are handled as entities that are themselves passed around the network.  Of course the UX is just a representation of the underlying entity, but in the current implementation there is no layer between the User and the task itself.  In the proposed design, this will shift slightly to passing messages that refer to tasks instead.\n\n\n\n\n  \n\nIn this early working mock, we can see this with the following elements:\n\n\nWe will NOT be able to use Task assignment emails for this bc users will not have connected their email accounts.  We will need to use the internal task events instead.\nThis will mean we will need to filter clover task related emails from sync.\n(we will need to think about how this would leave emails on the gmail side)\n\n\nWhen a task assignment is created in Clover, it can be assigned to a Department or an individual.\nWhen a task is assigned to a department, it must first be accepted by a member of that department, before being worked\n\n\nWhen a Task is assigned from the \u201cCreate\u201d new conversation / task button.  The task may be assigned to a department or an individual user at any connected company\n\n\nWhen a task is assigned from within another task conversation, the new task:\nhttps://www.figma.com/file/RxP4aMHPfcdUSJLFgz9KZkcd/Ledgerset-UI-UX-2019?node-id=17550%3A49901&t=Amc4e7tBHHYj1tjf-1 \n* will be assigned to the selected assignee or department\n* the assignee or department are added to the conversation from which the new task", "doc_id": "895f51f9-3326-4171-b12a-d315b30849f4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "663c80059a7fb92e142f067e38eabf16d900d45b4515dfef7c8c5aac85dc56af", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3264, "end": 7138}, "relationships": {"1": "17fb4c64-4f18-404e-8d5c-3c9bb2cfe20f", "2": "b91763a8-2e02-4a30-a84a-8c61030986b6", "3": "73e4f26f-4f08-4b1c-80e9-62fb784ba4aa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "73e4f26f-4f08-4b1c-80e9-62fb784ba4aa": {"__data__": {"text": "a task is assigned to a department, it must first be accepted by a member of that department, before being worked\n\n\nWhen a Task is assigned from the \u201cCreate\u201d new conversation / task button.

This should eventually include or provide the ability to easily view:\n   1. Task Name\n   2. Task status\n   3. Task Age\n   4. A way to get to the task history view\n   5. A \u201cView\u201d link or button that when clicked, brings the user to the first screen of the task response wizard, from where they would need to \u201cAccept\u201d.  Note that this solves the problem with Department assignment nicely.  In this approach, department members would all see a copy of the task assignment, and when someone clicks the view button, then accepts the linked task, the task will become assigned to that User.  Assignment will move the message out of any Unassigned view like inbox.\n* Implement a system that does not rely on email for task assignment communication (for users without email accounts).\n* Trigger the task view generation based on internal system events.\n* Ensure that the task view is accessible and functional for users regardless of their email account status.\n* Implement a conversation details header that visually groups users as assignees, users from the assigner's company, and users from the assignee's company.\n* Manage task visibility using the same rules as conversation visibility, applying to both task conversations and email conversations.\n* Eliminate the need for a separate task view in the application, with all required views provided by the sent conversations view.\n* Determine task visibility based on direct assignee status, department membership, or @mention in the task conversation, rather than team membership.\n* Ensure that task results are only visible to assignees and not to all people in the company.\n\n\n \n________________\nAddress Books and Contacts\nThe address book allows Users to view and manage their contacts.  \nAddress Book \n* All Users will have access to an Address Book, but the contents of that address book will vary based on their license tier, team membership, channel connections\nContacts\n* Contacts are synced from each connected gmail account\u2019s contacts, in addition to those created during platform Signup and Invitation, and through administrative tools like Company Import.\n\n\n* Contacts from all of these sources are grouped for display into the following categories.  \n\n\nShared Contacts\n* Default for contacts in a team inbox\n* Administered at a Team Level[j][k][l][m][n][o]\n* Available to everyone at your company\n* Listed in Company Profile Contacts section[p][q] for their associated company (we\u2019d need to associate them to headquarters?)[r][s][t]\n* Available for use in all channels/messages in a team Inbox\n\n\nPrivate Contacts\n* Default for Contacts in a private inbox (My Inbox)\n* Administered at a User Level \n* Available to only the User who created them\n* Available for use in all", "doc_id": "73e4f26f-4f08-4b1c-80e9-62fb784ba4aa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f314ffe90a2deffa056d0d9b2a3f2744288ad3a73d1e4e8677339b50dccf7b4d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7213, "end": 11063}, "relationships": {"1": "17fb4c64-4f18-404e-8d5c-3c9bb2cfe20f", "2": "895f51f9-3326-4171-b12a-d315b30849f4", "3": "efedd559-2c1f-4bb6-aea5-1c13ccc47ab6"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "efedd559-2c1f-4bb6-aea5-1c13ccc47ab6": {"__data__": {"text": "contacts, in addition to those created during platform Signup and Invitation, and through administrative tools like Company Import.\n\n\n* Contacts from all of these sources are grouped for display into the following categories.  \n\n\nShared Contacts\n* Default for contacts in a team inbox\n* Administered at a Team Level[j][k][l][m][n][o]\n* Available to everyone at your company\n* Listed in Company Profile Contacts section[p][q] for their associated company (we\u2019d need to associate them to headquarters?)[r][s][t]\n* Available for use in all channels/messages in a team Inbox\n\n\nPrivate Contacts\n* Default for Contacts in a private inbox (My Inbox)\n* Administered at a User Level \n* Available to only the User who created them\n* Available for use in all channels/messages in a personal Inbox\n\n\nAuto-Created\n* Administered at a User Level\n* These are partial contact records, often containing minimal information (email, name, and possibly a profile photo), that are created by Clover automatically when you receive an email from an email address that is not in your contacts\nHaving access to these contacts allows Users to quickly add contacts they want to retain to their address book as shared or\nBy default, automatically-created contacts are only accessible to Users that are involved in conversations with that contact. We should allow a User to add an automatically-created contact to:\n\n\n* Add to Shared contacts - add this contact to the shared contacts list in the Address book, and cause the contact to be shared with their company.\n* Add to Private contacts - create a private copy of the contact and add it to the User\u2019s private contacts list in their Address Book. This new private contact copy will only be visible to the User that created it.\n________________\nSearch\n* Global search will be modified to use a third-party search solution called Algolia\n   * Search will be federated to return matching results across multiple entities like Conversations, Companies, Products, etc. (UX is TBD)[u]\n   * Exact text matching -  Search results will only display entries that contain the exact text you enter. For instance, searching for \"Pete\" will yield results containing only \"Pete\" and not \"Peter\" or \"Peters.\"\n   * Prefix search - To find an email from Sarah McDonald, enter \"sar*\" or \"coll*\" without quotes.\n   * Exact phrase search: To search for a precise phrase, enclose the text in quotation marks, e.g., \"Weekly Team Update.\"\n   * Combining search filters: You can use multiple search filters simultaneously to refine your search results.\n   * Result ranking: The ranking of suggested search results depends on the frequency and location of the search term within key fields, such as recipient, subject, body, comments, etc. Each field carries a different weight. More recent results are assigned higher weights, as they are more likely to be relevant.\n   * Excluding Trash and Spam: By default, the Trash and Spam folders should not be included in keyword searches. \n* Context Related Search - we will implement using a vector db like Pinecone and an embeddings model from OpenAI.  This will require near real time indexing of new data in the Relationship Timeline, so we will use something like langchain.

Because Gmail uses labels internally for controlling where and how emails are displayed/categorized.  Every email that is synchronized to an inbox in Clover, will have one or more System Labels associated with it [INBOX, SPAM, TRASH, UNREAD, STARRED, IMPORTANT, SENT, DRAFT] (*Note that \"ARCHIVE\" is not a label.  A message is archived when it does not have any of the following tags on it [INBOX, SPAM, TRASH, UNREAD, SENT, DRAFT] according to the way Gmail operates.  \n* We can choose to extend this Gmail approach and also use these system labels to control how our various views are filtered.  \n* Note - We sync labels from gmail only if we have at least one message labeled. Nylas doesn't support webhooks for labels, so we can only track them at messages level.\n* There is a limitation on the nylas side that prevents us from being able to associate more than one label to a contact.  There is a ticket with them to resolve this, but we will not target this contact label support for initial release.\n\n\nViews\nViews are pre-configured filters that allow for easy categorization of conversations. Views make use of conversation labels, statuses and other properties to work their magic.

For example, this allows a User in a team mailbox to clear out their inbox view without archiving or snoozing, or unfollowing the conversation for other teammates.\n* Assigned to me - All Conversations that have been assigned to the current User, and are OPEN[z]\n* Shared with me - All Conversations where you have been @mentioned, and are OPEN[aa][ab][ac][ad][ae][af]\n* Starred - All Conversations with the \"STARRED\" label\n* Sent - All Conversations with the \"SENT\" label[ag][ah][ai] \n* Drafts - All Conversations with the \"DRAFT\" label\n* Snoozed - All Conversations with the \"SNOOZE\" label\n* All - all conversations with none of the following labels [INBOX, SPAM, TRASH, UNREAD, SENT, DRAFT]\n* Spam - All Conversations with the \"SPAM\" label\n* Trash - All Conversations with the \"TRASH\" label\n* Open - conversations with an OPEN", "doc_id": "c2fa7f1b-e242-4dc1-b30d-9362c49d18dd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1cb9b2c0418c340931a2620ed601e825f5e944eaf43038e66f25a00f11bba3b6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 14964, "end": 18621}, "relationships": {"1": "17fb4c64-4f18-404e-8d5c-3c9bb2cfe20f", "2": "efedd559-2c1f-4bb6-aea5-1c13ccc47ab6", "3": "39f54e10-46b9-4517-ba49-66009d078496"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "39f54e10-46b9-4517-ba49-66009d078496": {"__data__": {"text": "been assigned to the current User, and are OPEN[z]\n* Shared with me - All Conversations where you have been @mentioned, and are OPEN[aa][ab][ac][ad][ae][af]\n* Starred - All Conversations with the \"STARRED\" label\n* Sent - All Conversations with the \"SENT\" label[ag][ah][ai] \n* Drafts - All Conversations with the \"DRAFT\" label\n* Snoozed - All Conversations with the \"SNOOZE\" label\n* All - all conversations with none of the following labels [INBOX, SPAM, TRASH, UNREAD, SENT, DRAFT]\n* Spam - All Conversations with the \"SPAM\" label\n* Trash - All Conversations with the \"TRASH\" label\n* Open - conversations with an OPEN status.  \n* Closed - conversations with a CLOSED status.[aj][ak]\n\n\n* Custom views will also be supported in the future.  \n* Custom views will be defined at both a User and a Team level\nMessage Templates\nMessage Templates are preformatted templates that can be used to quickly create a message or reply.\n\n\n* Message Templates are available at T2 and T3[al] for both Private and Team workspaces\n* Team message templates allow Admin Users to create templates for messages in any supported Channel (gmail for now) that can be used by everyone in a Team Workspace to increase productivity\n* Message templates may eventually be made available for Channel types other than just email.

[Shawn] - Exactly!\n\n\nWhat happened on the JoshSales side? Does the new conversation appear in the shared folder in his private workspace? [Shawn] - Exactly!\n\n\nIn addition, can I mention anyone outside the company? Or it could be possible only if the user from another company is a member of a conversation [Shawn] - No.  In my mind, these are all \"Private\" conversations among the Users at the company.\n[h]@dmitry.derepovskyi@clovercollab.com and @ludmila.nesvitiy@ledgerset.com and team, please resolve these comments or any others you feel is no longer relevant or has been resolved, as we go\n[i]As a result, JoshSales will join our conversation.\n[D] - is @JoshSales able to assign his private tag to this shared conversation potentially?\n\n\nNo. In my mind, these are all \"Private\" conversations among the Users at the company. \n[D] - I am not sure that I got it. Does it mean that we can mention only the contact from our company and a member of the conversation? or only a company contact? \nIn my opinion, we can add an ability to mention only members of the chat/conversation in the first release. And if the user wants to mention someone outside of the chat they should add a new member and then mention them.\n[j]Do you mean that each user in the company can update this contact?\n[k]and should we sync this info back to Gmail?\n[l]Good catch.

If you aren't already, please start to familiarize yourself with these!\n[w]Den, doesn't have to be implemented in this way, but it feels natural to me.  Thoughts?\n[x]If we only want a \"Clover BOT\", then tying it to a conversation input and \"slash commands\" is sufficient. However, if we want a \"Clover AI\", it should not be limited to these inputs. A better approach would be to replicate the behavior of an AI assistant that can be called out from any place with a shortcut (e.g. Google Assistant or Lens, Siri, Alexa, Tailor AI). This approach might be more difficult to implement since the AI needs to be aware of the context, but it will provide more opportunities in the future.\n[y]Good points, Den.  I think we could evolve in that direction, but I do think the majority of the AI we will present to the user as such, will be through chat (a bot).  Search for example, will use a bunch of ai tech under the hood, and may even have some UI bling to promote it as AI, but it's just lipstick.  I'd like to embrace the idea of a bot called clover. If we end up having a need for more ways to interact with it, we can consider other ways to access then.
